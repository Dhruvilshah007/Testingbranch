/*
Lambda expression in java is an anonymous (no name) function that does not need to define the data type of input parameters and does not need to have a return type. Lambda expression in java implements the functional interface and it can be treated as any other java object. It can be used to create threads, comparators and can be used to add event Listeners.

Functional interfaces (or Single Abstract Method Interfaces) are interfaces that have only one abstract method, such as Runnable, Callable, and ActionListener.
 */
/*
An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as functional interface.
