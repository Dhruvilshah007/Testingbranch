Whenever e need normal queue we use LinkedList

Whenever e need stack(FIFO) we use ArrayDequeue


If you want to implement stack(LIFO)a use stack class in jav
If you want to implement queue(FIFO) use linkedlist
If you want to implement dequeue use arrayDeque


Priority Queue

Never try to iterate over priority queue,its bad choice

In java we can iterate over PQ ,why and how?
->PQ is implementing Queue
  Queue extending Collections
  Collections implementing Iterable

Yes, we can iterate but wont get desired output of elements as per priority.Because idealy You would be iterating over a tree.
